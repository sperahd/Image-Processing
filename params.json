Further compression is possible only if it is lossy.\r\n\r\nPixel: A small point in an image. For example: ARGB requires 4 bytes for each pixel(1 byte a(alpha), r, g, b). YUV420 requires 6 bytes per 4 pixels.\r\n\r\n__ Elementary Streams: \r\n        Every ES is a pid in TS. Thumb rule: If something has a pid it is an ES. PAT is an ES, PMT is an ES etc.\r\n        All ES are packetised into PES. An ES can be divided into multiple PES. The PES might be intermixed, e.g. a, v, a, a, a, v, v, v, a, PAT, PMT. \r\nPES generally have a fixed length apart from a case of a video ES.\r\n",
